            <h2>Personal Pick From AI Businesses</h2>
            <p> From the given AI businesses I think that "Predictive maintenance for manufacturing plants" would be significantly beneficial as many Jamaicans rely on agriculture to<br> stay afloat and the preventative measures these systems would enforce can prevent small businesses from dying out. As with all AI powered solutions ethical issues <br>will emerge such as job displacement and loss of traditional practices, however I believe these issues can be circumvented through striking a balance between both worlds. An example of an app that uses this technology is:</p>

                <div class="cw">
                    <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
                    <p> This chapter consists mainly of a conversation taking place between two friends catching up after a long while of being apart, this conversation goes into themes of growing relationships being like gardening and setting goals for oneself.<br> Both these messages being spoken in the chapter can be easily applicable going forward in life, to pace myself through multiple goals, being proud of what I achieved to get there and to take care of the people I care about along the way.</p>
                    <p> Chapter Quote - “Just decide what you want to do and then get started. That is one of the most powerful lessons in life.”</p>

                    <h2> Chapter 5 </h2>
                    <p> Chapter 5 serves as a continuation of the conversation started in Chapter 4, building off into spending your time wisely. <br>I can personally connect with Micheal's sentiments on not feeling able to commit to my set goals due to other things in life demanding my time and Charlie's reassuring answers are as applicable to Micheal's life as they are to mine</p>

                    <p> Chapter 7, again, continues the conversation begun in the previous chapter with the focus now being on Self-learning through observation, refelction and most importantly reading. <br>Charlie convinces Micheal over the course of the chapter to give reading a go in order to facilitate his own self growth.</p>
